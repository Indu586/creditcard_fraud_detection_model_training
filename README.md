# creditcard_fraud_detection_model_training
##  Introduction 
The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation.

Due to confidentiality issues, the original features and more background information about the data are not provided.

Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA;
The only features which have not been transformed with PCA are Time and Amount.
Feature Class is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

##  Steps 
###  1. Understand the Data 
* Carefully examine the dataset's features, labels, and structure.
* Identify the target variable, which typically indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of the data, identify outliers, and spot patterns.
###  2. Data Preprocessing 
* Handle missing values and outliers if present.
* Normalize or scale the features, especially if you're using machine learning models sensitive to feature scaling.
* Balance the dataset if it's heavily imbalanced. Techniques like oversampling/undersampling or SMOTE could help.
###  3. Model Selection and Training 
* Experiment with various models like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
* Use cross-validation to identify the best-performing model.
###  4. Model Evaluation 
* Measure the performance using appropriate metrics like ROC-AUC, F1 score, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
